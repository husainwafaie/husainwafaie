## 🌟 Previously
I previously interned at Omdena and Integrated Diagnostics Holdings as a full-stack software engineer, working on multiple full-stack applications and backend systems. I was also an undergraduate researcher at the UCI Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems Lab where I designed machine learning algorithms for an autonomous drone configured by a Vicon System. Additionally, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant at the UC Irvine CS school where I held office hours and exam review sessions for more than 320 students.

I was also a mentor for UCI-hosted hackathons, which were hosted by <a href="https://hack.ics.uci.edu/" target="_blank">Hack at UCI</a>. I provided guidance for teams and helped debug their code and applications. I was also involved in the <a href="https://www.qc-uci.club/" target="_blank">Quantum Computing Club at UCI</a>, where I designed a classical CNN mixed with variational quantum circuits to yield the highest accuracy for a self-driving model. Finally, I was the UCI Archery Club President, leading all club business and events.
## 🚀 What I'm currently doing
I'm currently the software development team lead at <a href="https://ucicansat.github.io/web/" target="_blank">UCI CanSat</a>, where we build a satellite that is launched to simulate the landing sequence of a planetary probe in the International CanSat competition hosted by NASA and AAS. My team and I placed 4th out of 140 teams worldwide! I'm currently also the team lead at UCI NewU, a cryptocurrency trading platform sponsored by Avalanche and Bitdeer.

I'm looking for new grad SWE roles while finishing up my bachelor's degree at UC Irvine to graduate in July 2024!
