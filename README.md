## 🌟 Previously
I previously interned at Omdena and Integrated Diagnostics Holdings as a software engineer intern where I build internal tools and systems that leveraged backend technologies/frameworks such as Python Django and Java Spring Boot to support multiple full-stack platforms. I was also an undergraduate researcher at the UCI Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems Lab where I designed machine learning algorithms for an autonomous drone configured by a Vicon System. Additionally, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant at the UCI Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences where I held office hours and exam review sessions to more than 320 students.

I was also a mentor for UCI-hosted hackathons, which were hosted by Hack at UCI. I provided guidance for teams and helped debug their code and applications. I was also involved ind the Quantum Computing Club at UCI, where I designed a classical CNN mixed with variational quantum circuits to yield the highest accuracy for a self-driving model. Finally, I was the UCI Archery Club president, leading all club business and events.
## 🚀 What I'm currently doing
I'm currently the software development team lead at UCI CanSat, where we build a satellite that is launched to simulate the landing sequence of a planetary probe in the International CanSat competition hosted by NASA and AAS. My team and I were able to place 4th out of 140 teams around the world! I'm currently also the team lead at UCI NewU, a cryptocurrency trading platform sponsored by Avalanche and Bitdeer.

I'm looking for new grad SWE roles while finishing up my bachelor's degree at UC Irvine to graduate in July 2024!
