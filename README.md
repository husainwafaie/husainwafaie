## 🌟 Previously
I previously interned at Omdena and Integrated Diagnostics Holdings as a software engineer intern where I build internal tools and systems that leveraged backend technologies/frameworks such as Python Django and Java Spring Boot to support multiple full-stack platforms.
I was also an undergraduate researcher at the UCI Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems Lab where I designed machine learning algorithms for an autonomous drone configured by a Vicon System. Additionally, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant at the UCI Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences where I held office hours and exam review sessions to more than 320 students.
I was also a mentor for UCI-hosted hackathons, which were hosted by Hack at UCI. I provided guidance for teams and helped debug their code and applications. I was also involved
